# GESTBOARD - Gesture Controlled Keyboard



# What is pyGARL?
pyGARL stands for _Python Gesture Analysis and Recognition Library_ and, as you may expect, it's used to build gesture recognition systems.
I decided to build it because, after the success of my previous project ( the Gesture Keyboard ), I felt that a general purpose gesture recognition library would have been useful for a lot of people.

# Installation
The installation is pretty straightforward:

`pip install pygarl`

**NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS**: the package requires scikit-learn and scipy to work. The easy way to install them is by using Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/download/ ).
